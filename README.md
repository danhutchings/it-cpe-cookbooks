# IT-CPE-Cookbooks
The IT-CPE-Cookbooks ("Client Platform Engineering") repo contains a suite of cookbooks that we use to manage our fleet of client devices.

## Notes
In order to use most of these cookbooks, you must also deploy some of Facebook's cookbooks found [here](https://github.com/facebook/IT-CPE/tree/master/itchef)

The following Facebook cookbooks will more than likely be required:
- cpe_init
- cpe_launchd
- cpe_profiles
- cpe_utils

The following Facebook cookbooks are also recommended for dynamic configurations:
- cpe_node_customizations
- cpe_user_customizations
